This document is for my GitHubRepoAssignment where I am practicing creating remote and local repositories.
First I created a repository on GitHub called "GitHubRepoAssignment" then I created a directory with the matching name.
Then I created a local(master) repository in my newly created dir, GitHubRepoAssignment,  by initializing 
a git repository using the command "git init." 
After the the repository was constructed, I went ahead and created this readme.txt file and then added,commited ,
then pushed my changes upstream.
